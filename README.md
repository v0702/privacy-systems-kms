Three main entities:
    Server
    Operator
    Client

Download from release the kms.zip, there will be 3 .jar files, these are the exeutable.

To run:
$java -jar filename.jar

If running in intellij, make sure that multiple instances is enabled in build configurations for multiple Clients/Operators.

When executing Client or Operator Server ip will be asked, press enter (no input) for local server.

From there just operate as normally, each entity as its work flow menu, server menu is a little wonky and there is no need to operate it at the moment.
